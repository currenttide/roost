# Loop journal

Append-only evidence log. One entry per iteration, format per `PROTOCOL.md`.
Entries are written by the loop; humans read, never need to edit.

## 2026-06-05 — pre-loop: repo truth pass + backlog audit (interactive session)
- Verdict: shipped (uncommitted, on feat/agent-substrate)
- Branch/PR: feat/agent-substrate / - (working tree, user reviewing)
- What changed: 27-agent map→verify→fix workflow corrected 8 stale prose spots
  (README.md ×3, server.py ×2, worker.py, service.py, schema.py — see git diff).
  Then the backlog itself was audited against the verified map: R5 and R12 closed
  as `invalid` (survey claims refuted by code), R14 closed as `done`, R1/R2/R3/R7/
  R11/R13 re-scoped to what the code actually lacks (details inline in BACKLOG.md).
- Evidence:
  - `python -m pytest -q` → 347 passed in 9.53s (after edits)
  - argv check: `_build_docker_argv` is exec-style w/ guards (refutes shell-injection claim);
    `prune_expired` wired at server.py:2395; rollback guards re-raise (server.py:222 etc.)
- Judge: - (predates the loop; fixes were verified by independent skeptic agents in the workflow)
- Notes: original single-agent survey overstated 3 of 14 ranked items — adversarial
  verification before implementation is earning its keep. Known dangling ref
  mobile-app/ios/README.md:137 deliberately left for I1 (merge heals it).

## 2026-06-06 04:30 UTC — I0: Prove the verification paths the loop will rely on
- Verdict: shipped
- Branch/PR: loop/i0-verification-plumbing / (PR pending judge)
- What changed: no product code — environment plumbing + backlog/journal bookkeeping.
  Admin auth fixed, CLI repointed to this checkout, Mac node proven with Xcode,
  artifact round-trip through the blob store verified byte-identical.
- Evidence:
  - `roost workers` → 16 nodes listed (was 401); mac-mini-m4 idle, seen 0s ago
  - `pip install -e .` → editable mapping now `/workspace/yang/roost-oss/roost` (was `/workspace/yang/agent_fleet`); `pip show roost` confirms; Python 3.12.8
  - `roost exec mac-mini-m4 "xcodebuild -version && xcrun simctl list devices | head -15"` → Xcode 26.2 / Build 17C52, device list returned, iPhone 17 Pro (Booted), exit_code=0
  - `POST /blobs/presign` → blob ab1499820fe3; Mac job: `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot` + `curl PUT` → `{"size":280802,"sha256":"5381727b…","state":"ready"}`; local download sha256 identical (`5381727b9276a9e730b84ce762d8e2032ccfecc8a0443186da1d7accfa1021d7`), `file` says PNG 1206x2622 — screenshot shows the Roost iOS app live against this fleet
  - `python -m pytest -q` → 347 passed in 9.46s (no code changed; ratchet held)
- Judge: approve (round 1) — re-ran pytest (347 passed in 9.29s), `roost workers`
  (16 nodes), editable-location check, artifact sha256 + `file`, CP healthz, and
  corroborated the Mac jobs via `roost jobs`; scope/honesty/deviation all passed.
- Models: implementer claude-opus-4-8 / judge claude-sonnet-4-6
- Notes: DEVIATION (logged, not silent): PR targets `feat/agent-substrate`, not
  `master` — LOOP/ exists only on that branch until I1 merges it; a master-based
  PR would smuggle I1's whole merge in. Admin token lives at
  `~/roost-fleet/admin_token` → `~/.config/roost/config.toml` (0600), never in
  the repo. The CP self-reports v0.2.0 while pyproject.toml says 0.1.0 —
  version drift noted to Proposed.
